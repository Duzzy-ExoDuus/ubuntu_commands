Elastic IP

Not sure if it is Elastic IP or not but in Ucloud.cn it is known as 弹性IP

In general you can ssh to your Visural PC via public IP address, but on that pc you will not find this "public ip" when ifconfig

In case your have some json-rpc service which blind to some public IP, in this case just change that IP to the one you have.

You should be able to acess it through public IP with no problem as well as that port is not been blocked by firewall.
