    Easiest way to do this is as follows (thanks to aaa in this thread):

    # linux32 bash

    â†‘ 32 bit terminal
 make hdecode
make install-hdecode
    #./configure --prefix=/home/yourname/htk

    (may also need to: yum install libx11-devel)

#make clean # else make error& link problem: i386:x86-64 architecture of input file, incompatible with i386 output

#make clean    
#make all

    #make install

copy hdecode to the same folder as htk
in the htk folder
make hdecode
make install-hdecode
